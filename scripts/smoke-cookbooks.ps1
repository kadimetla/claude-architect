.SYNOPSIS
    Smoke-run the Anthropic cookbook notebooks the course cites against the
    live Claude API. Reports pass/fail per cookbook; never modifies vendored
    cookbook content.

.DESCRIPTION
    Tim Warner's course cites ~8 cookbooks from claude-cookbooks-main/ as
    "see this for deeper study" references. Learners who click into them
    should JUST RUN. This script smokes the runnable subset (7 of 8) against
    the live API via `uv run --project notebooks jupyter nbconvert --execute`,
    matching the smoke pattern the course's own notebooks already use.

    The 7 cookbooks smoked here, with last-known status (2026-05-21):
      PASS  tool_use/tool_choice.ipynb
      PASS  tool_use/customer_service_agent.ipynb     (kernel-override required)
      PASS  tool_use/tool_use_with_pydantic.ipynb     (kernel-override + email-validator)
      PASS  tool_use/extracting_structured_json.ipynb (kernel-override + requests + bs4)
      PASS  misc/prompt_caching.ipynb                 (requests + bs4)
      FAIL  tool_use/parallel_tools.ipynb             (upstream cookbook bug: tool_use
                                                       blocks emitted without matching
                                                       tool_result. API rejects 400.
                                                       Anthropic-side fix needed.)
      FAIL  tool_use/automatic-context-compaction.ipynb (upstream SDK-drift:
                                                       cookbook reads block.text but
                                                       newer anthropic SDK returns a
                                                       dict. Anthropic-side fix needed.)

    The 8th cited cookbook (claude_agent_sdk/01_The_chief_of_staff_agent.ipynb)
    is RED and intentionally not smoked here. It needs the claude-agent-sdk
    Python package plus the Claude Code CLI binary plus a multi-file sibling
    project. Treat it like examples/mcp_cli/ - separate uv subproject, not
    something to wire into notebooks/.venv. Deferred to a future sprint.

    The two FAIL entries are documented because they're real upstream issues,
    not env issues. Re-smoking them here remains useful as a regression test;
    when Anthropic pushes a fix to their cookbooks repo and we re-pull the
    vendored snapshot, the FAIL turning to PASS confirms the fix landed.

    Smoke output lands at claude-cookbooks-main/<dir>/_smoke-<name>.ipynb.
    These files are gitignored - they're transient by design. Re-running
    the script overwrites them; deleting them is safe.

    Vendored cookbook content is NEVER modified. The script only reads
    from claude-cookbooks-main/ and writes to gitignored smoke artifacts
    next to each cookbook.

.PARAMETER Only
    Substring filter. Only cookbooks whose path contains this substring
    will be smoked. Useful for re-running a single cookbook after a fix.
    Optional; default is all 7.

.PARAMETER SkipBudgetCheck
    Skip the cost confirmation prompt. Each cookbook costs roughly $0.02 to
    $0.10 against the live API; full run is ~$0.30. Optional.

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\smoke-cookbooks.ps1
    Smoke all 7 runnable cookbooks. Prompts for cost confirmation first.

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\smoke-cookbooks.ps1 -Only prompt_caching
    Re-smoke just the prompt_caching cookbook after a dep change.

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\smoke-cookbooks.ps1 -SkipBudgetCheck
    Skip the prompt and start smoking immediately. Useful in CI / scripts.

.NOTES
    Author: Tim Warner
    Author-note: cookbook content is vendored from Anthropic under MIT.
    Modifying it would force a NOTICE.md modification count increment
    (currently 0 for claude-cookbooks-main/, 2 for examples/mcp_cli/).
    This script preserves the 0-modification count by writing smokes to
    sibling files instead.
