.SYNOPSIS
    On-rails launcher for the vendored MCP CLI reference app in examples/mcp_cli/.

.DESCRIPTION
    Mirrors the single-command UX that the teaching notebooks already enjoy:

        Notebooks: uv run --project notebooks jupyter lab notebooks/
        MCP CLI:   .\scripts\run-mcp-cli.ps1

    First run does three things idempotently:
      1. Creates examples/mcp_cli/.env from .env.example if it does not exist.
      2. Lifts ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from the repo-root .env into the new file so the
         learner does not have to paste the key twice.
      3. Hands off to `uv run --directory examples/mcp_cli main.py`, which lets
         uv auto-create examples/mcp_cli/.venv on first invocation (~20s cold,
         ~1.5s warm thereafter).

    The vendored mcp_cli/ tree is untouched. This script is the only on-rails
    bridge; the upstream Skilljar README workflow still works unchanged.

.PARAMETER ServerScripts
    Additional MCP server scripts to attach as clients (forwarded to main.py
    positional args). Useful for instructor demos that want to plug in a second
    FastMCP server alongside the bundled mcp_server.py. Optional.

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\run-mcp-cli.ps1
    First run from a clean checkout, assuming repo-root .env has ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.
    Creates examples/mcp_cli/.env, lifts the key, then launches the chat REPL.

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\run-mcp-cli.ps1 -ServerScripts .\path\to\extra_server.py
    Launches the CLI with an additional MCP server attached.

.NOTES
    Author: Tim Warner
    Why a wrapper instead of doc-only? The notebooks setup tells learners to
    create ONE .env at the repo root. The vendored mcp_cli expects its own .env
    inside examples/mcp_cli/. Without a bridge, learners paste the API key
    twice and inevitably let the two copies drift. This script eliminates that
    friction without modifying vendored code (preserves NOTICE.md fidelity).
