"""Cell builder for segment-2-5-control-surfaces.ipynb.

Bridge / deep-dive notebook between Segments 2 and 3. Self-study
material, not live-taught in the 4-hour window. Action-packed CCA-F
exam stud across four control surfaces the other notebooks touch
lightly:

  1. Tool enumeration (four lenses, MCP `list_tools` as headliner)
  2. `tool_choice` depth + `disable_parallel_tool_use`
  3. Stop conditions (`stop_reason`, `stop_sequences`, `max_tokens`,
     `pause_turn`, `refusal`)
  4. Managed Agents in Claude Console: `memory_stores`, `vaults`,
     `agents`, `sessions` (live SDK surface, confirmed via spike)
  5. CCA-F exam stud (cheat sheet + 5 inline practice questions)

Maps to all five CCA-F domains. Haiku 4.5 throughout except where
Sonnet 4.6 is the only option (e.g. retrieving a Console agent whose
configured model is Sonnet 4.6).

# Segment 2.5: Control surfaces, tool enumeration, and the Console asset surface

**Duration:** ~75 minutes if walked end-to-end. Self-study / Q&A overflow, not live-taught in the 4-hour window.
**Maps to:** CCA-F **all five domains** (Domain 1 stop_reason, Domain 2 tool_choice, Domain 3 Console assets, Domain 4 forced extraction, Domain 5 memory).
**References:** [`../domain-1-agentic.md`](../domain-1-agentic.md), [`../domain-2-tools-mcp.md`](../domain-2-tools-mcp.md), [`../domain-3-claude-code.md`](../domain-3-claude-code.md), [`../domain-4-prompts.md`](../domain-4-prompts.md), [`../domain-5-context.md`](../domain-5-context.md).

Segments 1-3 teach the agentic loop, tool design, and structured extraction. This bridge notebook teaches the **control surfaces** underneath those demos: the levers you reach for when a production agent misbehaves. Four levers, one Console asset surface, one cheat sheet, five practice questions.

The notebook also doubles as **CCA-F exam stud**. Every section ends with the API field name, value enumeration, and the production decision rule the exam will probe.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this notebook you will be able to:

- **Distinguish the three tiers tools come from**: Anthropic-hosted server tools (`bash_20250124`, `code_execution_20250522`, etc., registered by `type`), MCP-server tools (discovered via `list_tools` and merged at runtime), and Claude Code harness tools (`Read`/`Edit`/`Bash` - **not** API-reachable). Know which tier to reach for given a production requirement.
- **Run the enumeration discipline** every production agent owes its operators: log what your code registered (static view) AND what the model actually saw per iteration (runtime view)
- Pick the right **`tool_choice`** mode (`auto`, `any`, `tool`, `none`) for a given guarantee, and know when to set **`disable_parallel_tool_use`**
- Branch correctly on every **`stop_reason`** value, force a deterministic cutoff with **`stop_sequences`**, and use **`max_tokens`** as a control lever rather than just a budget
- Address Console-managed assets from the Anthropic SDK: **`memory_stores`** (`oreilly-memory-store`), **`vaults`** (`oreilly-vault`), **`agents`** (Deep Researcher), and **`sessions`** (the runtime that ties them together)
- Answer the five CCA-F practice questions at the end of the notebook without peeking at the rationales

## Setup

This notebook hits the live API across all four control surfaces, including the **Managed Agents** beta (`memory_stores`, `vaults`, `agents`, `sessions`). Budget: roughly **$0.10** for a full top-to-bottom run.

## Section 1: Three tiers tools come from (and the boundary that matters)

**The question architects keep asking wrong:** *"can my custom agent use Bash?"*

The answer is yes, no, and yes - depending on which **Bash** you mean. There are **three tiers** tools come from, and they are easy to conflate because two of them are spelled the same:

| Tier | Who hosts | Who invokes | Who executes | Registered via | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Server tools** | Anthropic | Model | Anthropic | `tools=[{"type": "bash_20250124", ...}]` | `bash_20250124`, `code_execution_20250522`, `web_search_20250305`, `text_editor_20250728`, `memory_20250818`, `computer_20250124` |
| **2. MCP-server tools** | You (or a vendor) | Model | The MCP server's process | `list_tools()` -> merge into `tools=[]` | filesystem, GitHub, Stripe, your in-house APIs |
| **3. Harness tools** | The Claude Code CLI itself | The harness | The harness's TypeScript runtime | **not API-reachable** | `Read`, `Edit`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Write`, `TaskCreate` |

**The teaching beat that catches everyone**: when Claude Code uses `Bash`, that is tier 3 (harness-private TypeScript). When *your* custom agent registers `bash_20250124`, that is tier 1 (Anthropic-hosted server tool). **Same noun, totally different runtimes.** A misbehaving agent is almost always a mismatch between these two **runtimes** - the model called the bash *primitive* but your code is looking for a *harness* response, or vice versa.

The rest of this section teaches each tier with one *why* and one runnable demo (or, for tier 3, the explicit boundary). Then the closing cells show the **enumeration discipline** every production agent should run: log what your code registered AND what the model actually saw, every turn.
"""

_tier1_md = """\
### Tier 1: Anthropic-hosted server tools (the primitives you don't write)

**Analogy:** **electrical wall outlets**. Every building needs them; nobody wants every tenant wiring their own. There is a standard plug shape (the `type=` identifier), the utility company runs the grid (Anthropic), and you just plug in. You don't own the power plant; you own what you do with the power.

**Why this tier exists:** some capabilities are universal enough that every agent wants them and dangerous enough that you should not implement them yourself. Code execution. Web search. Filesystem editing. Shell. Computer control. Memory. If every customer wrote their own sandbox and their own search, the security and quality variance would be catastrophic. Anthropic hosts the runtime so you do not have to.

**How you recognize them:** the tool definition is keyed by `type` (a versioned identifier like `bash_20250124`) instead of by `name` alone. The model invokes them just like custom tools, but the *execution* happens server-side. You do not run a client-side tool loop for these; the result lands in the same response.

The two demos below make this concrete and show the **spectrum of server-tool execution semantics**. The first uses **`bash_20250124`**: the model receives the tool definition, decides to call it, and your code sees a normal `tool_use` block. You still execute it (Anthropic runs the model's *decision*, not the shell command - that part is yours to sandbox). The second uses **`code_execution_20250522`**: the model writes Python, Anthropic runs it in a sandboxed container, and the *result* comes back inside the same response as a `code_execution_tool_result` block. **No client loop required.** The `stop_reason` is already `end_turn` when your code sees the response.

That second pattern is the load-bearing exam insight: **server tools that fully execute server-side eliminate the agentic loop for the tools Anthropic hosts.** It is the cleanest example of "managed runtime beats hand-rolled runtime" you will see in this course.

### Tier 2: MCP-server tools (the primitives you write, hosted elsewhere)

**Analogy:** **USB peripherals**. The protocol is standard (any computer with a USB port can talk to any USB device), but each device is built and maintained by a different vendor (or by you). You plug a printer in; the printer's tools become available. Unplug it; they go away. The computer didn't need a printer driver hardcoded - the protocol did the introspection at plug-in time.

**Why this tier exists:** server tools (tier 1) cover the universals - shell, search, code execution. Everything else - your internal APIs, your vendor integrations, your domain-specific tools - is too specific for Anthropic to host. MCP closes that gap by giving you a **standard protocol** for exposing your own tools to any MCP-aware agent (Claude Code, Cursor, custom). You write a server once; every MCP client can discover it.

**How tier 2 differs from tier 1:** the tools are hosted in **your** process (or a vendor's), not Anthropic's. The model still invokes them by emitting a `tool_use` block; your MCP client routes the call to the right server; the server runs the implementation and returns a result. This is also the **tier that scales by configuration, not code**. Add a new MCP server to `.mcp.json` and your agent gains its tools without a source change.

**The discovery primitive** is `list_tools()`. The MCP client calls it against each connected server and merges the schemas into the `tools=[]` array passed to `messages.create()`. The reference implementation in this repo:

- `examples/mcp_cli/mcp_client.py:69-71` - `MCPClient.list_tools()`
- `examples/mcp_cli/core/tools.py:10-23` - `ToolManager.get_all_tools()` (merge-across-servers)

Below we print those excerpts verbatim. **They are short.** The pattern is small because the protocol does the heavy lifting.

### Tier 3: the Claude Code harness surface (the boundary you cannot cross)

**Analogy:** **a car's onboard diagnostics**. The dashboard shows you the check-engine light (`/help` shows you Claude Code's tools). The mechanic can plug into the OBD port to read more (you can walk `~/.claude/skills/`). But the engine controller's firmware is **inside the car** - you cannot install Toyota's brake controller into a Ford by API. The harness is the firmware; harness tools are firmware-private.

**Why this tier is different:** Claude Code (`claude.ai/code`, the CLI you may be using to *build* this course) is itself an agent. When it executes `Read`, `Edit`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Write`, `Bash`, `TaskCreate`, those calls **never appear in the `tools=[...]` parameter of a Messages API request you can see.** They are implemented inside the harness process in TypeScript, and the harness only exposes them to *its own* model session.

This is the **boundary architects keep tripping over**: you cannot register Claude Code's `Bash` from your custom agent. What you can register is `bash_20250124` (tier 1), which is a different runtime with a different sandbox model, different streaming semantics, and a different security envelope. They share a name. They share almost nothing else.

| If you want... | Reach for... | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Your custom agent to run shell commands | Tier 1: `bash_20250124` | API-reachable; you implement the sandbox |
| Your custom agent to call your in-house APIs | Tier 2: MCP server | Protocol-standard, hot-pluggable via `.mcp.json` |
| Claude Code to do an arbitrary thing in *its* loop | Tier 3: a **slash command** or **skill** | Discovered via `/help`, `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/settings.json` |

**You discover tier 3 through the harness, not the API:**

- Inside Claude Code, run `/help` to see slash commands and skills
- Read `~/.claude/settings.json` to see what is registered globally
- Walk `~/.claude/skills/` to see what is invokable
- Check project-scoped `.mcp.json` files for MCP servers Claude Code itself can reach (those are tier 2 from the harness's perspective)

**Exam beat (and the trap that catches working architects):** "What tools does Claude Code expose?" and "what tools can my custom agent use?" are two different questions with two different answers. The API surface is universal; the harness surface is local to the harness. When you build a custom agent, you live in tiers 1 and 2.
"""

_enumeration_md = """\
### The enumeration discipline (regardless of tier)

**Analogy:** **flight crew checklists**. Pilots don't trust their memory at takeoff or landing - they **read** the checklist out loud and **confirm** every item. Production agents are the same. You don't trust "I'm pretty sure the model has all four tools registered." You log, every startup and every iteration, what your code registered AND what the model actually saw.

Mismatches between those two are where most production bugs hide. Two views, both mandatory:

1. **Static view at startup**: iterate `tools=[...]` and log every name, schema, and any `cache_control` flag. Like the pre-flight checklist.
2. **Runtime view per iteration**: in the agentic loop, log the *scoped* tool list and the active `tool_choice` after every turn. Like the in-flight checklist at each phase change. When a model "forgot" a tool, the log will show the scoped tools list never included it.

## Section 2: `tool_choice` depth

**Analogy:** `tool_choice` is the **traffic light** at the intersection where the model decides whether to call a tool. Four colors:

| Mode | Traffic-light analogy | Guarantee | Use when |
|------|-----------------------|-----------|----------|
| `{"type": "auto"}` | **Green light, no escort.** Model proceeds however it judges. | Model decides; may answer in prose | Default; let the model pick tools or text |
| `{"type": "any"}` | **Green light, tow truck behind you.** You MUST move; you pick the lane. | Model **must** call some tool; model picks which | Action is required, model picks the verb |
| `{"type": "tool", "name": "X"}` | **Forced left turn.** Only one legal move. | Model **must** call tool X | Forced structured output; the Domain 4 cheat code |
| `{"type": "none"}` | **Red light.** Stay put and explain yourself. | Tools registered, but model **cannot** call them | "Explain, don't act" turns |

Add **`disable_parallel_tool_use: true`** when ordering matters - the model emits one tool call per turn instead of a parallel batch.

The next four cells exercise each mode against the live API. **The thing to watch in every demo is the `stop_reason` flip** - it's the API's ground-truth verdict on which branch the model took. Never parse the prose to decide; trust `stop_reason`.

Same prompt, same tools, two `tool_choice` values. The prompt is deliberately ambiguous (no city named, asks about "kinds of data") so the model has a real choice to make.

This is **the** Domain 4 trick. Define a schema as a tool. Force the model to call that tool. The `tool_use.input` block is now schema-guaranteed - no JSON parsing, no ```` ```json ```` fence-stripping, no validation rituals. The SDK validated the schema for you. **The model can no more skip a required field than a passenger can skip the passport number on the entry form.**

Production code branches on that record, not on prose intuition.

Domain 1's hard rule: **never parse natural language to decide if the model is done. Always branch on `stop_reason`.**

The six values, what each one means, and what to do next:

| `stop_reason` | What happened | Next action |
|---|---|---|
| `end_turn` | Model finished cleanly | Return the response to the user |
| `max_tokens` | You ran out of output budget | Resume by feeding the partial turn back in, or surface as truncation |
| `stop_sequence` | A token from `stop_sequences` matched | Use the matched `stop_sequence` to dispatch |
| `tool_use` | Model emitted at least one `tool_use` block | Execute the tools, append `tool_result`, loop |
| `pause_turn` | Long-running task paused itself | Send the assistant message back unchanged to resume |

**`refusal`** is a streaming-time policy intervention - the model declines to continue. It is not an error to retry blindly. Surface the situation, log it, and decide product-side whether to rephrase or escalate.

# Section 4: Managed Agents in Claude Console (live SDK surface)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

_console_section_md = """\
## Section 4: Claude Console assets are first-class SDK resources

**Analogy:** Claude Console is not a control room with a window onto the engine - it **is** the engine. **Same key, same wires.** The API token that calls `messages.create()` is the same one that addresses `client.beta.memory_stores`, `client.beta.vaults`, `client.beta.agents`, and `client.beta.sessions`. Two interfaces (UI and SDK), one runtime underneath.

**Why this section exists:** Segment 1 taught you to build an agentic loop **from scratch** - your code drives messages, tool calls, and `stop_reason` branching. That's the right pattern when you need full control. But three production needs change the calculus:

1. **Long-lived memory** (across kernel restarts, machine reboots, credential rotations) - hand-rolling this is a database design problem you do not want to own.
2. **Third-party credentials** (GitHub tokens, vendor OAuth, MCP server secrets) - keeping these out of source while still letting the agent use them is a security design problem you do not want to own.
3. **Multi-step agent recipes** (research, code review, deep summarization) - if the recipe is reusable across customers/projects/teams, the recipe should live in one place, not get re-coded in every client.

Managed Agents give you these three for free. Claude Console is not a UI on top of Anthropic - it is a **managed-agents control plane with a full SDK surface**:

| Console asset | SDK resource | Sub-resources |
|---|---|---|
| Memory stores | `client.beta.memory_stores` | `.memories`, `.memory_versions` |
| Vaults | `client.beta.vaults` | `.credentials` (incl. `mcp_oauth_validate`) |
| Agents | `client.beta.agents` | `.versions` |
| Sessions (runtime) | `client.beta.sessions` | `.events`, `.threads`, `.resources` |
| Environments | `client.beta.environments` | `.work` |
| Skills | `client.beta.skills` | `.versions` |
| Files | `client.beta.files` | upload/download |

All of these require the beta header `anthropic-beta: managed-agents-2026-04-01`. We set it once at the top of the notebook.

**This section runs against Tim's Default workspace assets**: `oreilly-memory-store`, `oreilly-vault`, and the Deep Researcher template agent. If you are running this on your own account, the `list()` calls will return your assets instead. The pattern is identical.

**Analogy:** a **safety-deposit box at your bank**. You don't carry the box around (it doesn't depend on which laptop you're using). The bank manages backups, durability, and access control. You hold a *reference* (the box number); the value lives at the bank. Different boxes can be shared across multiple people (multiple sessions) with the right key.

A **memory store** is a Console-managed, server-side persistence layer for an agent's memories. Critically different from the **Memory tool** (`memory_20250818`), which is *client-side* - with the Memory tool, YOU implement the filesystem and YOU own durability. With a memory store, Anthropic does. Same conceptual goal, two very different runtime locations.

Memory store advantages:

- Survives kernel restarts, machine reboots, and credential rotations

### `oreilly-vault` (Domain 3: secrets out of source, even in notebooks)

**Analogy:** a **hotel safe**. The hotel knows you have a safe (the vault exists), the hotel knows what kinds of things you store (credential metadata), but the hotel does not know what is *inside* (the values). Only you can open it, and even then only at the safe (at agent-call time), never over the phone (never returned in an API response).

A **vault** stores credentials your agent uses to talk to third-party services - GitHub tokens, OpenAI keys, MCP server OAuth tokens. Two SDK surfaces:

- `client.beta.vaults` - manage the vault itself (create, list, archive)
- `client.beta.vaults.credentials` - manage credentials inside it (create, retrieve metadata, **`mcp_oauth_validate`** for MCP OAuth flows)

**Production pattern:** mount vaults into a session via `sessions.create(vault_ids=[...])`. The agent's tools resolve credential **references** at call time. The credential **values** never appear in your notebook, your logs, or your laptop's process memory.

### Deep Researcher agent (Domain 1: agents you don't have to write the loop for)

**Analogy:** a **recipe vs. a kitchen**. Segment 1 built an agentic loop from scratch - your code is the kitchen, and you're also writing the recipe by hand every time. Managed Agents are **pre-written recipes**: the agent definition (`client.beta.agents`) is the recipe (system prompt, allowed tools, default model), and a **session** (`client.beta.sessions`) is a kitchen with that recipe loaded and running. You can swap kitchens (environments) without re-writing the recipe.

Segment 1's agent loop is "I'll cook this myself, following a printed recipe." Managed Agents is "I'll order from a restaurant whose chef knows this dish by heart." The trade-off: less control, more reliability, and the recipe lives in one place rather than in every client.

The Deep Researcher template agent in Tim's Default workspace:

- Model: `claude-sonnet-4-6` (configured in the Console; the API respects it)
- Tools: `agent_toolset_20260401` with `always_allow` permission
- System prompt: opinionated research workflow (decompose, search, read in full, synthesize with citations, note gaps)

You invoke it by creating a **session** that references the agent, an environment, and (optionally) vaults. The session is the runtime; the agent is the recipe.

### One-page cheat sheet

**`tool_choice` modes** (Domain 2):

| Mode | Forces what? | When to pick |
|---|---|---|
| `{"type": "auto"}` | nothing | default |
| `{"type": "any"}` | a tool call (model picks which) | action required, model picks verb |
| `{"type": "tool", "name": "X"}` | call to tool X | forced structured output |
| `{"type": "none"}` | no tool calls | "explain, don't act" |
| add `disable_parallel_tool_use: true` | one tool per turn | ordering matters |

**`stop_reason` values** (Domain 1, **never parse prose to decide**):

- `end_turn` - done; return to user
- `tool_use` - execute tools, append `tool_result`, loop
- `max_tokens` - resume by replaying the partial assistant turn
- `stop_sequence` - dispatch on `resp.stop_sequence`
- `pause_turn` - resend assistant message unchanged to continue
- `refusal` - streaming policy intervention; surface, don't blind-retry

**Tool enumeration lenses**:

1. Static - print `tools=[...]`
2. Runtime loop - log scoped tools + `tool_choice` per iteration
3. MCP - `client.list_tools()` against each server, merge
4. Harness (Claude Code) - separate surface, not API-introspectable

**Console assets via SDK** (require `anthropic-beta: managed-agents-2026-04-01`):

- `client.beta.memory_stores` - persistence (Domain 5)
- `client.beta.vaults` (+ `.credentials`) - secrets (Domain 3)
- `client.beta.agents` + `client.beta.sessions` - managed loop (Domain 1)

### Five practice questions

Answer first. Rationale is below each question. These are distinct from the 60 in the capstone deck.

---

**Q1** (Domain 2). You need an agent that *must* call a specific extraction tool and return data that conforms to its schema. Which `tool_choice` value do you set?

- A. `{"type": "auto"}`
- B. `{"type": "any"}`
- C. `{"type": "tool", "name": "extract"}`
- D. `{"type": "none"}`

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

**C**. `auto` lets the model answer in prose; `any` forces *some* tool but not the specific one; `none` forbids tool calls. Only `{"type": "tool", "name": "X"}` guarantees the call lands on the schema-bearing tool.
</details>

---

**Q2** (Domain 1). Your agent's response has `stop_reason = "max_tokens"`. The user expected a complete answer. What is the correct production behavior?

- A. Raise an error - the model failed
- B. Strip the partial output and retry with a fresh prompt
- C. Replay the partial assistant turn as a new `messages.create()` and ask the model to continue
- D. Parse the partial output for completion markers and decide based on text

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

**C**. `max_tokens` is a budget cap, not a failure. You append the partial assistant turn to the conversation and request a continuation. (A) is wrong because the model did exactly what you asked. (B) discards work. (D) violates the "never parse prose to decide control flow" rule.
</details>

---

**Q3** (Domain 2). You want the model to call two tools, but the second one **must** see the first's output. What do you set?

- A. `tool_choice = {"type": "any"}` only
- B. `tool_choice = {"type": "auto", "disable_parallel_tool_use": true}`
- C. `stop_sequences = ["TOOL_DONE"]`
- D. Send two separate requests, one per tool

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

**B**. By default Claude may emit both tool calls in one turn as a parallel batch. `disable_parallel_tool_use` forces one-per-turn so you can return the first tool's `tool_result` before the second call is decided. (C) doesn't sequence tools. (D) works but is unnecessary plumbing the SDK can do for you.
</details>

---

**Q4** (Domain 5). You want agent memory that survives kernel restarts, container rebuilds, and credential rotations. Which surface do you use?

- A. The client-side Memory tool (`memory_20250818`) with a local filesystem handler
- B. `client.beta.memory_stores` in the Console
- C. A `system` prompt containing the memory text
- D. `stop_sequences` to mark memory boundaries

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

**B**. The Memory tool (A) is **client-side** - persistence is your responsibility, and local files do not survive container rebuilds. `memory_stores` (B) is server-managed in Anthropic's Console and survives restarts. (C) is not persistence, it is per-request context. (D) is a generation control, not memory.
</details>

---

**Q5** (Domain 2 + 3). An agent connects to three MCP servers via `.mcp.json`. New tools are added to one server. How does the agent learn about them without a code change?

- A. The Anthropic API auto-discovers all MCP tools
- B. The client calls `list_tools` against each MCP server at startup and merges results into the `tools=[...]` array
- C. The agent reads the server's source code via `claude -p`
- D. The model is trained on the server's tool schemas

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

**B**. MCP tools are **server-exposed, runtime-discovered**. The MCP client calls `list_tools` against each connected server; whatever the server returns is what the agent can call. (A) is wrong - the Messages API does not introspect MCP servers for you. (C) confuses Claude Code's headless mode with MCP discovery. (D) confuses training data with runtime tool registration.
</details>

_bridge_md = """\
## Bridge: where to next

You have now seen every control surface the four teaching segments use, plus the Managed Agents surface most of the Console runs on. The pieces:

- **Segment 1** built the loop you can now introspect with lens 2
- **Segment 2** uses `tool_choice` for scoping and structured errors
- **Segment 3** uses forced `tool_choice` + Pydantic validation for invoice extraction
- **This notebook** is the reference card under all three, plus the Console asset surface

For the capstone (Segment 4) and the CCA-F itself, the load-bearing facts are the **two enumerations** in the cheat sheet: every `stop_reason` value and every `tool_choice` mode. If you can recite both from memory along with the production decision rule for each, you are ready.

**Bridge to Segment 3:** the forced `tool_choice = {"type": "tool", "name": "extract_invoice"}` pattern you just learned is the engine of the invoice extractor. Open `segment-3-invoice-extractor.ipynb` and watch it run against nested schemas with validation retries.
