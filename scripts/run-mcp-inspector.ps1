.SYNOPSIS
    Launch the MCP Inspector against the vendored FastMCP demo server.

.DESCRIPTION
    On-rails launcher for `mcp dev` (the MCP Inspector) pointed at
    examples/mcp_cli/mcp_server.py. Mirrors the lifecycle posture of
    run-jupyter.ps1 / stop-jupyter.ps1: it owns its known ports and
    refuses to start on top of a Windows half-state.

    First it nukes any process squatting on the two Inspector ports:

      6274  Inspector web UI
      6277  Inspector proxy server

    `mcp dev` shells out to `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`, a Node
    web app. If a previous run did not shut down cleanly, the orphaned
    node processes hold those ports, the new `mcp dev` aborts with
    "PORT IS IN USE", and no browser tab ever opens. This script clears
    that state before launch, then opens the Inspector URL in the default
    browser once the proxy is listening.

    The vendored examples/mcp_cli/ tree is untouched. This script is a
    pure on-rails bridge; the upstream `uv run mcp dev mcp_server.py`
    workflow still works unchanged.

.PARAMETER UiPort
    Inspector web UI port. Defaults to 6274.

.PARAMETER ProxyPort
    Inspector proxy server port. Defaults to 6277.

.PARAMETER TimeoutSeconds
    Seconds to wait for the proxy port to start listening before opening
    the browser. Defaults to 30.

.PARAMETER NoBrowser
    Skip the auto-open. Inspector still starts; you open the printed URL
    yourself. Useful when teaching the manual workflow on camera.

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\run-mcp-inspector.ps1
    Frees ports 6274/6277, starts the Inspector against the demo server,
    and opens http://localhost:6274 once the proxy is up.

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\run-mcp-inspector.ps1 -NoBrowser
    Same launch, but does not auto-open the browser.

.NOTES
    Author: Tim Warner
    Why a wrapper? The "Inspector won't jump up" failure is almost always
    an orphaned node process from a prior run holding port 6277. That is
    the same class of Windows half-state stop-jupyter.ps1 already guards
    against. This script makes the MCP demo lifecycle just as reliable.
